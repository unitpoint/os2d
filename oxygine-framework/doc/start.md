#How To Start

###Windows, MacOSX users
[Download](http://oxygine.org/download.php) Oxygine. I recommend to download **All-In-One** version with SDL. It includes everything to fast and easy start and has prebuilt SDL binaries.

Go to oxygine-framework/examples folder and open any of them. Each example has configuration folders for different platforms/OS:

* **proj.win32** - solutions for VisualStudio
* **proj.ios** - iOS xcode project
* **proj.macosx** - MacOSX xcode project
* *proj.android* - build folder for Android SDK/NDK
* *proj.cmake* - CMake configuration folder
* *proj.emscripten* - Emscripten configuration folder

> to build for android, cmake, emscripten check **oxygine-framework/readme** folder

###Advanced users 

If you want to setup and build everything yourself then [download](http://oxygine.org/download.php) oxygine framework only.
   
Go to **oxygine-framework/readme** folder and follow instructions **readme.txt**

###Marmalade SDK
If you are *MarmaladeSDK* user then follow *Advanced users* in instructions.


##Next Steps
Oxygine has some tools written in Python and you need to install them for advanced usage.

* [Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install Python version 2.7.*
* [Download](http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/) and install PIL for Python


##Generate own project 
You could generate own project outside of oxygine-framework folder by **gen_template.py** tool. It is located in
  
	oxygine-framework/tools/

Run **gen_template.py** script with Python, example:

	python gen_template.py MyProjectName -t win32 -d path/to/MyProject/

It would create empty solution *MyProject* for Visual Studio in the folder *path/to/MyProject*

see for more info: 
	
	python gen_template.py --help
