1. start from readme.txt

if you are using Oxygine All-In-One version with SDL included you could skip #2
just go to any example and open it

2. There are prebuilt example solutions for VS2010 and VS2013:
=================================================================================================
- build SDL:
  - open SDL\include\SDL_config_windows.h in any text editor
  - find this line:
    #define SDL_AUDIO_DRIVER_XAUDIO2    1
  - and comment it:
    //#define SDL_AUDIO_DRIVER_XAUDIO2    1
  - goto folder SDL\VisualC\ 
  - open SDL_VS2010.sln (or any other) and build it as Release
  - goto golder SDL\VisualC\Win32\Release\
  - and copy SDL2.lib, SDL2main.lib and SDL2.dll to oxygine-framework/libs

- goto oxygine-framework\examples and choose any example. Lets call it "Demo" 
- open solution located in oxygine-framework\examples\Demo\proj.win32\
- try to build Demo
- copy all dlls from  oxygine-framework\oxygine\third_party\win32\dlls\
   and SDL2.dll from oxygine-framework/libs 
   to  oxygine-framework\examples\Demo\data\   
- working directory of Demo project should point to "../data" folder (right mouse click on Demo -> project->properties->ConfigurationProperties->Debugging->WorkingDirectory)
- ready! run!
=================================================================================================

3. You could generate your own Solution anywhere
- you need installed Python 2.7
- you need to run this script
  oxygine-framework\tools\gen_template.py

example:
	python gen_template.py MyProject -t win32 -d path/to/MyProject/
